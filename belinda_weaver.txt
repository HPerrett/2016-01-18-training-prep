Hi. My name is Belinda Weaver, and I lead a team of eResearch analysts for the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation. I organised this training workshop and hope to help Aleksandra with the training during the workshop. I am a Software Carpentry instructor, and organise most of the Software Carpentry events in Queensland.
