My name is Leah Roberts and I am a PhD candidate at the University of Queensland (St Lucia, Australia).
I am currently in the first year of my PhD, focusing on microbial genomics. Our lab works with next-gen sequencing data and has an interest in designing visualisation tools to better analyse large genomics datasets. 
I have beginner-intermediate programming skills in bash and python and have attended Software Carpentry once in the past (2014, UQ).
